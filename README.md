There are two files for the Arduino, the echo (server) and the ping (client).


The server file should be uploaded to the engineer's arduino, and that arduino should be plugged into their device.
The client files will be uploaded to all the arduinoâ€™s connected to the Pi/raspberry shakes.


Instructions:
Establish a connection with a client by inputting the client address into the serial monitor, and then run the ArduinoTo Files python program, and wait for all the data to be received and stored in text files on your device. Once this is over, wait a moment before you decide to establish and draw data from other client addresses.

Here is the link to all the python code required to run this: https://github.com/rs-Web-Interface-CRISiSLab/shake-to-lora
